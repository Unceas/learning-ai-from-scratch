# Day 5 – Error and Loss in Machine Learning

## What is Error?

Error is the difference between the predicted value and the actual value.

Error = Actual Output – Predicted Output

## Why Loss Function?

A loss function measures how bad the model's predictions are.

Common idea:
- Lower loss = better model

Understanding loss is essential before training any ML model.
