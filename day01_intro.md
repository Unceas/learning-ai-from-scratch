# Day 1 – Introduction to AI & ML

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence refers to systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include:

- Learning from data
- Recognizing patterns
- Understanding language
- Making decisions
- Visual perception

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed. Rather than following pre-written rules, ML algorithms improve their performance through experience.

## Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning inspired by biological neural networks, using artificial neural networks with multiple layers to process data.

## Learning Goals

- Understand AI, ML, and DL fundamentals
- Implement algorithms from scratch
- Apply concepts using Python
- Build practical projects

## Key Concepts to Master

1. **Supervised Learning** - Learning from labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning** - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning** - Learning through rewards and penalties

## Next Steps

- Set up Python environment
- Learn NumPy and Pandas basics
- Implement simple ML algorithms
- Practice with real datasets
