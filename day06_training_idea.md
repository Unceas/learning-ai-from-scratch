# Day 6 – Idea of Training a Model

Training a model means adjusting parameters so predictions improve.

For linear regression:
- Parameters: m (slope), c (intercept)
- Goal: Reduce loss

Training is an iterative process:
1. Predict output
2. Calculate error
3. Update parameters
4. Repeat

This process will later be automated using algorithms.
