# Day 3 – Linear Regression Intuition

Linear regression is used to find a relationship between:
- Input (x)
- Output (y)

The goal is to find a line:
y = mx + c

Where:
- m = slope
- c = intercept

The model tries to minimize error between predicted and actual values.

This will later be implemented from scratch using Python.
